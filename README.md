# EvolutionGame

Explore using an evolutionary algorithm with ML 

Purpose:  
Create an AI that finds an optimized solution to a survival 
game (block jumping over obstacles) 

The block character is allowed 2 degrees of freedom
1. jump up and down
2. move forward and backward

The block(character)'s goal is to dodge incoming obstacles coming
from the right at random intervals and speeds

In the training set:
a predefined map will be used to select the "fittest" block after
n number of generations using the evolutionary algo

In the test set:
using the "fittest" block we will test out the evolutionary algo

Afterwards we can either repeat said experiment or explore better optimized algo.
